#TAPIR Sound Tag
**TAPIR Sound Tag** is a MIT-licensed open source software framework that allows users to communicate data signals through “Theoretically Audible, but Practically Inaudible Range” (TAPIR) of sound. You can find more detailed information at http://jiminis.me/tapir/

Although some issues, such as occasional unstable behaviors on 64-bit platform, are already reported, I have not maintained this code since summer 2014, and don't have any future plan to keep maintaining this at this moment also. Please contact me if you have any issues or questions with this project. 

##Getting Started
###iOS
1. You need *AFNetworking* binary matching to your target platform in advance.
```
$ cd ./extern
$ ./build_afnetworking
```
2-1. To build *TAPIR Sound Tag* only, open ```Tapir/Tapir.xcodeproj``` with XCode.

2-2. If you want to see more applicable examples, open ```Tapir.xcworkspace```.
