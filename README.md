#TAPIR Sound Tag
**TAPIR Sound Tag** is a MIT-licensed open source software framework that allows users to communicate data signals through “Theoretically Audible, but Practically Inaudible Range” (TAPIR) of sound with mobile devices. You can find more detailed information at http://jiminis.me/tapir/

Although some issues, such as occasional unstable behaviors on 64-bit platform, are already reported, I have not maintained this code since summer 2014, and don't have any future plan this moment also. Please contact me if you have any issues or questions with this project. 

##Supported Platforms
