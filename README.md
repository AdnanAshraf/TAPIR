##Warning
I made this project public by adding some revisions on the last update of mid 2014. In spite of some reported issues, such as occasional appearances of unstable behaviors on 64-bit platform, currently I don't have any future plan of progresses (at least at this moment). Please contact me if you have any issues or questions. 

##Supported Platforms
- Apple iOS (8+)
- Google Android (21+, only supports Eclipse + ADT)

## Etc.
This project is based on the patented technology under South Korean patent law. Please contact me if you have any issues or questions about that.
